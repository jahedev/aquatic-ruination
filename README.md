Group 8: Mohammed Hossain, Daanyal Javed, Mehmet Sahin, Jinwei Shao

Teaching Goal: To teach users about different types of human-generated pollution that appears in the sea and its influence on marine life as a consequence.

Teaching Methods: Throughout the game, we will be using in-game demonstrations of the occurrence of pollution and their consequences on marine life, including on our player’s fish character. And we will also use pop-ups throughout the game that appear to the player as they move towards a specific “pollution” event. For example, if they move towards an area where a fish becomes entrapped by a plastic bottle, we will show the player a specific fact about this reality, educating the player about the specific issue.

Different Types of Pollution Related Issues that Appear in the Sea and How We Will Demonstrate Them In Our Game

Fish are becoming extinct due to the polluted environment they live in.
We can show that there are a lot of fishes in the beginning of the game, and throughout the duration of the game, these fishes die due to various circumstances that deal with pollution.

Fish are ingesting trash and toxic chemicals, such as: plastic bags, bottles, radioactive waste, oil spills, 
Other fishes in our game are eating trash and becoming exposed to toxic wastes which cause them to die. Our player’s fish tries to avoid and navigate around these objects and chemicals to survive.

Ocean species are becoming entrapped in plastic trash, such as: a straw, plastic bags, bottles, fishing net
Other fishes in our game become trapped if they collide with these specific trash items and eventually die. If our player gets trapped with one of these items, a trash sprite is wrapped around the player sprite, then their health starts to constantly decline at an accelerated rate.

Corals are disappearing due to overfishing and pollution (e.g. great barrier reef in Australia)
We could show swarms of fishes appearing and being picked up by a shit with a net, and we could show chemicals falling on the coral and as a result, they start disappearing in-game.

Trash islands in the sea: 
We could show the sea-floor becoming piled with trash, these “islands” do not disappear, and our player must avoid it to stay alive. When the user gets closer to the trash island or encounters it for the first time, a popup comes and gives information to the user.
