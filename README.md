# Serious Game Project | Final Submission | Teaching Goals

**Teaching Goal:** To teach users about different types of human-generated pollution that appears in the sea and its influence on marine life as a consequence.

**Teaching Methods:** Throughout the game, we will be using in-game demonstrations of the occurrence of pollution and their consequences on marine life. We use pop-ups throughout the game that appear to the player as they move towards a specific "pollution event."

- Fish are becoming extinct due to the polluted environment they live in.
- Fish are ingesting trash and toxic chemicals, such as: plastic bags, bottles, radioactive waste, oil spills, 
- Corals disappear due to overfishing and pollution.
- Trash islands in the sea: We show the sea-floor becoming piled with trash, these “islands” do not disappear, and our player must avoid it to stay alive.
